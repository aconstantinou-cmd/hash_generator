# File Hasher
This script is a simple file hasher that computes the SHA1, MD5, and SHA256 hash values of a given file. It's a command-line utility that makes use of Python's hashlib module for hash computation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

##Usage
To use this script, run the following command in your terminal:

```
python file_hasher.py -f <file_path>
```
Replace <file_path> with the path to the file you want to compute the hash values for.

## Example
If you want to compute the hash values of a file called example.txt, run the following command:

```
python file_hasher.py -f example.txt
```

The script will output the SHA1, MD5, and SHA256 hash values for the specified file.
